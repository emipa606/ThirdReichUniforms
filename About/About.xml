--- Original Description ---
Uniforms of the Third Reich.

--

Uniforms include:

Infantry with camo

Waffen SS with Camo

Officer varients

Fallschirmjagers

Winter varients

Military police



All textures were done by me and coding, its not the most optimized; coding could be better but this mod will be finalized on a later date.


Future plans:

Soviets

Empire of Japan

Commonwealth

Also special thanks to T4NDY for making a Russian language patch</description>
